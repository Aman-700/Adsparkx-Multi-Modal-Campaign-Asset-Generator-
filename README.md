## Multi-Modal Campaign Asset Generator

An AI-powered system that generates campaign assets, ad copy variations, image prompts, and ranked A/B test recommendations from a single campaign brief.
This project showcases a full multi-modal workflow integrating text generation, image generation, and automated evaluation.

**🚀 Project Overview**

The Multi-Modal Campaign Asset Generator automates the process of creating marketing assets by:

- Taking a campaign brief as input
- Generating multiple ad copy variations
- Creating image generation prompts for each copy
- Calling an image generation API
- Evaluating copy–image coherence
- Packaging top combinations into a downloadable output

This system helps marketers, designers, and advertisers generate content quickly with AI.
